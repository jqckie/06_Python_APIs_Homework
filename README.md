# Weather API Analysis

## Instructions
* Update your [api.openweathermap.org](api.openweathermap.org) API key in [api_keys.py](api_keys.py)
* Run [WeatherPy.ipynb](WeatherPy.ipynb) to create [cities.csv](output_data/cities.csv) and image files for each of the 4 visualizations.

## Background

Visualizing the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator by utilizing [CityPy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy) and the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

Building a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
